To learn more about resolvers see Resolvers API Reference.

Modify the `withAuthÂ°:

  const auth = createAuth({
    // ...
    resolver: async (props: any) => {
      const username = props.user.name as string;
      const email = props.user.email as string;

      return { email, username };
    },
      // ...
  });
```
