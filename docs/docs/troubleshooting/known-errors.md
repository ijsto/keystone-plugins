### All operational.

Currently, the only limitation is that you will need Keystone6 version `3.0.0` or above.

Older versions of Keystone6 are not supported at the moment, if you are using an older version, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/ijsto/keystone-plugins/issues/new) and request support for it.
