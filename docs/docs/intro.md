# About Keystone-6-oauth

Easily add third-party authentication providers to your Keystone6 app. Under the covers we use NextAuth.js (https://next-auth.js.org/) project to add social auth to Keystone-6 (https://keystonejs.com/).

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version `16.13.0` or above
- [Keystone6](https://keystonejs.com/) version `3.0.0` or above project

## Flexible and easy to use
- designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports OAuth 1.0, 1.0A, 2.0 and OpenID Connect (same as NextAuth)
- built-in support for many popular sign-in services
- supports email / passwordless authentication
- supports customization and provides ability to manipulate what is stored in the database via `resolver` function.

## Accessible and open source
- see Recipes for examples of how to use it in different scenarios
- video tutorials by the team and the Keystone community members
- contribute to improve the project by submitting a [new issue](https://github.com/ijsto/keystone-plugins/issues/new) and [pull requests](https://github.com/ijsto/keystone-plugins/pulls).

## Credits
