## Motivation

Wiring up third-party authenticators can be a very cumbersome task to take on.

With Keystone 6 OAuth we aim to provide you with a clear path and a set of instructions that will enable you to authenticate your users with [Providers](/oauth/providers.html) such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn and a many more.
